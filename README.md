### About Project

The purpose of this project was to create a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap; The portfolio being required to respond to three different screen sizes: small 400, medium 768, and large 992 widths.

###Task
create three html pages:

- index.html
- portfolio.html
- contact.html

Project requirements are written in this [directionalReadme](https://github.com/Kfields91/ResponsivePortfolio/blob/master/assets/directionalREADME.md).

additional directions indicated that portfolio pages were to be formatted as closely as possible to the images below:
